      <h2 class="tac">About Southwestern</h2>
      <p class="tac">For 175 years, Southwestern University has been engaging minds and transforming lives.

Committed to “Fostering a liberal arts community whose values and actions encourage contributions toward the well-being of humanity,” Southwestern is unique in many ways.

Our location in the heart of Central Texas allows our 1,528 students to enjoy the warm, small-town feel of historic Georgetown as well as the close proximity of Austin with its vibrant, innovative and creative culture.

Southwestern’s residential campus offers a true liberal arts education with small classes and numerous collaborative undergraduate research opportunities. Outside the classroom, students are civically engaged and volunteer in the community at more than twice the national average! Half of all students study abroad and most take advantage of leadership, service and activism opportunities in Southwestern’s 90+ student organizations. Our scholar-athletes compete on one of 20 NCAA Division III varsity teams. Go Pirates!

More than half of all Southwestern students complete at least one internship experience and 91 percent have found employment or have been accepted to graduate/professional school within 10 months of graduation. All of this (and more!) combine to create a lifelong Southwestern Experience.
