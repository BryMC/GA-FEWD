      <p class="tac">This project began all the way back in 2014. I was sitting amongst faculty and staff, waiting for a meeting to begin, when I overhead my University President talking about Paideia and his idea for an interactive course catalogue. I immediately began doodling in my notebook how the site would look and how the system would work. After a year of working with the Director of the Paideia Program, I realized the value the website could have for students. Although I've always had an interest in code, this gave me a real-world problem to apply my knowledge. Thanks to this class, I now understand enough about websites to be able to create an (albeit simplified) version of this website.</p>
